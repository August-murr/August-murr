# About Me

Hi, I'm **August**, an open-source machine learning engineer focused on **reinforcement learning** with large language models, especially for **agents like code-generating agents**.

I believe **RL** is the best way towards an **"Autonomous AI researcher"** and **AGI**, which will help guide us through the challenges that will arise towards the path of creating **superintelligence**. This includes everything from **scalability, superalignment, democratization**, and beyond.
